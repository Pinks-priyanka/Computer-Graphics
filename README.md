# Computer-Graphics

This repository marks my journey and knowledge in Computer Graphics.


# What You’ll Find Here

This repo contains projects that explore both the theory and practice of computer graphics, including:

Transformations & Math – coordinate systems, transformations, projection, and matrix operations.

Color & Light – color spaces, gamma correction, photometry, radiometry, and how light interacts with the eye.

Lighting Models – BRDFs, radiance/irradiance, and shading techniques.

Materials & Shading – diffuse and glossy surfaces, reflection, refraction, and specular exponents.

Ray Tracing – Whitted-style ray tracing with recursion depth and bias handling.

Procedural Texturing – checkerboards, gradients, and sine-based patterns.

Antialiasing – randomized sampling and averaging to reduce jagged edges.
