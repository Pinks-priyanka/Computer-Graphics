# Computer-Graphics

This repository marks my journey and knowledge in Computer Graphics.


# What You’ll Find Here

This repo contains projects that explore both the theory and practice of computer graphics, including:

Mathematical Foundations – coordinate systems, transformations, projection, and matrix operations.

Color & Light – color spaces, gamma correction, photometry, and radiometry.

Lighting Models – BRDFs, radiance/irradiance, and shading techniques.

Software Architecture – scene graphs, mesh data structures, and object-oriented 3D graphics design.

# My projects:

- Creating parametric Objects with parametric equations and mesh representations: [Project Link](https://jsfiddle.net/pinks01/vhc905ym/213/)
- Working with world transformations and ortographic viewing, lights and textures: [Project Link](https://jsfiddle.net/pinks01/4zfcL3t6/146/)
